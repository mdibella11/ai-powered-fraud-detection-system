# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

An advanced API designed to analyze transactions or activities (e.g., banking transactions or credit card payments) and determine if they present a fraud risk. This API leverages trained machine learning models to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.

---

## How the API Works

### 1. Sample Data (CSV File)
The project includes a sample dataset in `transaction_data.csv`. This file is used to train the machine learning model. The dataset contains the following example fields:

- **Transaction ID**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Date**: The date of the transaction.
- **Payment Method**: E.g., credit card, bank transfer, etc.
- **Location**: The user's location at the time of the transaction.
- **Activity Type**: E.g., purchase, withdrawal, etc.

**Sample CSV Example:**
```csv
transaction_id,amount,date,payment_method,location,activity_type
1,100,2025-01-01,credit_card,New York,purchase
2,500,2025-01-02,debit_card,Los Angeles,purchase
3,3000,2025-01-03,credit_card,London,withdrawal
4,50,2025-01-04,credit_card,Paris,purchase
```

### 2. Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using the dataset provided in the CSV file. Key steps in the training process:

- **Technologies Used:**
  - `scikit-learn` for basic machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
  - `XGBoost` for advanced modeling on large datasets.
  - `TensorFlow` for deep learning models (if required).

The training process supports multiple cloud platforms:

- **Azure**: Azure ML is used for training and deployment.
- **AWS**: SageMaker handles large dataset training and model hosting.
- **Google Cloud**: AI Platform manages training and model operations.

Setup instructions for each cloud platform are provided in respective `cloud/azure`, `cloud/aws`, and `cloud/google` folders.

### 3. Prediction Endpoint
The API exposes a RESTful endpoint to analyze transactions. Users can send transaction data in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": 12345,
  "amount": 200.0,
  "payment_method": "credit_card",
  "location": "Rome",
  "activity_type": "purchase"
}
```

The API processes this input, performs preprocessing (e.g., normalizing data, handling categorical values), and sends it to the trained model.

---

### 4. Fraud Detection Output
The model predicts whether the transaction is fraudulent and returns a response like this:

```json
{
  "transaction_id": 12345,
  "is_fraud": true,
  "fraud_probability": 0.85
}
```

In this example, transaction ID `12345` is flagged as fraudulent with an 85% probability.

---

### 5. Docker Deployment
The API is containerized for easier deployment using Docker.

**To build and run the container:**
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t fraud-detection-api .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-detection-api
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### 6. Environment Configuration
The project uses a `.env.example` file for managing environment variables like cloud service credentials. To configure:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Update the `.env` file with your credentials and configurations.
